# Special Backend

This project focuses on providing a robust backend for a product listing and searching interface, where users can filter, sort, and search products effectively. Main purpose was to learn the features of mongodb

## Key Features:

- **User Authentication:** Firebase is integrated for user login and registration, supporting both Google and GitHub authentication.
- **Product Filtering:** Users can filter products by `brandName`, `category`, and price range (`minPrice` and `maxPrice`).
- **Advanced Search:** Search functionality is available for product names using regex-based matching.
- **Sorting Options:** Products can be sorted by `price` (ascending/descending) and `date added` (newest/oldest).
- **Pagination:** Pagination is implemented to handle large datasets, allowing users to navigate through pages of products.
- **Data Fetching:** Separate API endpoints are provided to fetch distinct lists of brands and categories for dynamic dropdown menus.
